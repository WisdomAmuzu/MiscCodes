# MiscCodes
Codes I write to practice new Programming Languages or Concepts.
Simple to fairly complex Scripts/Progams I write in many different
Programing Languages. It also includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL (Maybe)
codes I have written and will write in future whilst studying these technologies.
From beginner friendly Python to intermediate java
to C++, etc. Some concepts, especially Object Oriented Programming
concepts have been implemented in all the three languages I currently 
know; i.e, Python, C++, Java (In order in which I learnt them).
I enjoy coding so much and I look forward to eventually contributing
towards something great with the skills I'm currently acquiring.
